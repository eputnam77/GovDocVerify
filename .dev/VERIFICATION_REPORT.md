# Verification Report

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- Metadata extraction supports title, author, last modified by, created, and modified fields.
  - See `extract_docx_metadata` implementation in `metadata_utils.py` lines 28-35.
- CLI processes documents and formats metadata in results.
- Basic documentation exists for installation using a single dependency file or Poetry.

## ‚ùå Missing Features
- README does not mention the `Created` and `Modified` metadata fields as required.
- Unit tests for metadata extraction and result formatting contain placeholder failures.
- Property-based test fails due to invalid Hypothesis strategy for datetimes.
- Semgrep scanning fails due to network restrictions.
- MyPy reports numerous type errors across the codebase.
- Mutation testing (`mutmut`) is unavailable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
- Installation instructions mention using a single dependency file or Poetry but tests still fail because README lacks full metadata list.
- Metadata extraction implementation exists, but tests verifying `created` and `modified` are incomplete.

## üìã Recommended Next Steps
1. Update README to list all metadata fields displayed (Title, Author, Last Modified By, Created, Modified).
2. Fix property-based test to generate datetimes with valid timezone strategy.
3. Replace `pytest.fail()` placeholders with real assertions in metadata tests and formatter tests.
4. Re-run MyPy and resolve type errors.
5. Configure Semgrep to use an offline config or allow network access.
6. Install and run `mutmut` for mutation testing.

**Routing Recommendation**: `builder` should implement the missing documentation and fix failing tests.
