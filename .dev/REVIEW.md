Integration and Design Review - 2025-07-18
==========================================

## PRD Coverage
- **Automated checks** for formatting, headings and accessibility are implemented via dedicated modules in `documentcheckertool/checks`. Unit tests exist for each module.
- **Metadata extraction** is handled by `extract_docx_metadata` and displayed in the report header (`ResultFormatter._add_header`). Tests `test_extract_docx_metadata` and `test_format_results_with_metadata` confirm behaviour.

## Integration Risks
- The FastAPI endpoint (`backend/api.py`) stores uploaded files on disk. Although cleanup occurs in a `finally` block, concurrent requests may lead to many temp files. Consider limiting uploads or using in-memory files.
- The rate limiter in `security.py` is memory-based; running multiple workers could bypass limits.
- `process_document` logic is duplicated in `app.py` and `cli.py`, increasing maintenance overhead and the chance of divergent behaviour.
- Mypy and pytest currently fail (over 1000 type errors and 27 collection errors), indicating potential integration or configuration issues.

## Performance Concerns
- Each request initializes `TerminologyManager` and parses patterns, which may impact latency. Explore caching or global instances.
- Opening large DOCX files with `python-docx` can be slow; no streaming support is present.

## Maintainability Observations
- Many functions are quite long (e.g., CLI argument parsing). Splitting into smaller helpers would aid readability and testing.
- Lack of type hints in several areas leads to extensive MyPy failures, reducing static analysis benefits.
- Some modules (e.g., `formatting.py`) contain complex conditionals; unit tests exist but code could be simplified.

## Mandatory Fixes
1. Address test collection failures to ensure the suite runs (`pytest` currently halts during collection).  
2. Resolve mypy errors to enable strict type checking.  
3. Evaluate temp file handling in `backend/api.py` to avoid leaking files under heavy load.  
4. Consider consolidating duplicate `process_document` implementations to reduce maintenance risk.

## Optional Improvements
- Investigate using shared caches for `TerminologyManager` and pattern data to improve performance.  
- Add persistent or distributed rate limiting if deploying with multiple workers.  
- Continue refactoring long functions into smaller units for clarity.
