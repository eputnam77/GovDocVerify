# Performance Report

This report summarizes profiling attempts and manual code review of the GovDocVerify project.

## Profiling Summary

- **Python cProfile**: `scripts/profile_build_results_dict.py` generates `perf/artifacts/build_results_dict.pstats`. The run shows only 7 function calls since the example uses a minimal stub.
- **Frontend bundle**: `npm run build` failed due to missing dependencies (`react`, `axios`, etc.). See `perf/artifacts/npm_build.log`.
- **API profiling**: FastAPI and uvicorn were missing so runtime profiling could not be executed.

## Observations

- No database layer detected in `src/` or `backend/`.
- Rate limiter stores request timestamps in a list for each client; appended using `dict.setdefault` is slightly faster.

## Recommendations

| Recommendation | Impact | Effort | Risk | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Use `dict.setdefault` when adding to `RateLimiter.requests` | Low | Trivial | Low | P1 |
| Add caching for processed documents via LRU or disk cache | Medium | Moderate | Low | P2 |
| Bundle analysis via `vite build --debug` once dependencies installed | Medium | Low | Low | P3 |
| Profile API with `k6` after installing FastAPI/uvicorn | High | Moderate | Medium | P3 |
